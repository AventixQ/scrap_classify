### Prompt for simplifying job titles

Simplify and normalize job titles so they sound natural in an email.  

**Rules:**  
- Keep titles concise, clear, and professional.  
- Always preserve the *role type* (e.g., Head, Lead, Chief, Founder, Partner, Manager, Director, Specialist, etc.).  
- Simplify only the descriptive part (e.g., "Head of Talent Success and Growth Lead" â†’ "Head of Talent Success").  
- Translate to English if needed.  
- Remove emojis and symbols.  
- If there are multiple roles, keep only the most important one.  
- Avoid long or redundant phrases â€” shorten to the core.  
- Capitalize correctly (e.g., "Team Lead", "Lead Developer").  
- If the title starts with "Chief of â€¦", replace with the correct abbreviation (CEO, CTO, CFO, CMO, COO, CHRO, etc.).  

**Examples:**  
- `Team Lead` â†’ `Team Lead`  
- `E-Commerce Architect & Innovation Engineer` â†’ `E-Commerce Architect`  
- `Lead Developer / Tech Lead` â†’ `Lead Developer`  
- `Head of Talent Success and Growth Lead, Solvoyo` â†’ `Head of Talent Success`  
- `ðŸš€ Senior Marketing Ninja` â†’ `Senior Marketing`  
- `Chief of Marketing in Shopify` â†’ `CMO`  
- `Chief of Technology` â†’ `CTO`  
- `Head of Marketing` â†’ `Head of Marketing`  
- `Head of Production` â†’ `Head of Production`  
- `Head of Finance` â†’ `Head of Finance`  
- `Founder, Managing Partner` â†’ `Founder`
